# Simmons-data-Analysis_Logistic_regression-model

Using the Simmonsdataset I have basically used a logistic regression model to predict coupon usage based on annual spending and the presence of a loyalty card. Through model training, we examined the coefficients and probabilities associated with coupon usage. This information could guide marketing strategies and promotions to target the right customers effectively.
